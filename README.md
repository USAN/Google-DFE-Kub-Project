The USAN Dialogflow Telephony Bridge makes the adoption of natural conversational speech IVR solutions quick and efficient. By adopting this USAN solution, you can connect your company's existing telephony systems and IVRs via industry-standard SIP to Google Dialogflow for the portions of your voice traffic that you would like to use for a proof-of-concept or limited initial functional launch. In this manner, you can innovate quickly and grow to full production easily. The solution manages the necessary media server capabilities to use the full Google Dialogflow feature set, including transfers of voice and data back to the enterprise as necessary.

With Dialogflow Telephony Bridge, you can quickly re-use your existing phone numbers and telephony infrastructure with Google Dialogflow Enterprise. This enables cutting-edge conversational experiences for your customers. You can deploy this Kubernetes application, which has a usage-based pricing model, with one click to the Google Kubernetes Engine in the Google Cloud Platform Marketplace.
